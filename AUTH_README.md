# 🔐 Authentication System - Quick Start

## ✨ What's Been Added

Your Vendor Management System now has **full authentication** with **role-based access control**!

### 🎯 Features:

- ✅ **Admin Role**: Full access to all data from all branches
- ✅ **Branch Role**: Can only add/view their own products
- ✅ **Secure Login**: Supabase authentication
- ✅ **Protected Routes**: Auto-redirect based on role
- ✅ **Session Management**: Stay logged in
- ✅ **Sign Out**: Secure logout functionality

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. **Configure Supabase**

Follow instructions in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` to:

- Create `user_profiles` table
- Set up security policies
- Create demo users

### 2. **Add Environment Variables**

Create/update `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. **Test Login**

Use demo accounts:

- **Admin**: admin@vendor.com / admin123
- **Branch**: branch@vendor.com / branch123

## 🗂️ How It Works

### User Flow:

```
1. Visit site → Redirected to /auth/login
2. Login with credentials
3. Auto-redirected based on role:
   - Admin → /admin (see all products)
   - Branch → /branch (see only their products)
```

### Branch User Workflow:

1. Login as branch user
2. Add products that customers purchase
3. Products are automatically tagged with branch ID
4. View only their branch's data

### Admin User Workflow:

1. Login as admin
2. View aggregated data from ALL branches
3. See all products, sales, and statistics
4. Monitor overall system performance
