# Frontend-Only Mode

This application now runs in **frontend-only mode** without any Supabase backend integration.

## ✅ What's Working

- **Full UI/Design**: All components, layouts, and styling are fully functional
- **Mock Authentication**: Simple login system with demo accounts
- **Local Storage**: User sessions persist in browser localStorage
- **Navigation**: All routes work (login, admin, branch dashboards)
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and branch user views are separated
- **Product Management UI**: All forms and modals work (data stored locally in component state)

## 🔑 Demo Accounts

### Admin Account

- **Email**: `admin@vendor.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Access**: Full admin dashboard view

### Branch Account

- **Email**: `branch@vendor.com`
- **Password**: `branch123`
- **Access**: Branch dashboard for recording purchases

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the app**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Login**: Use one of the demo accounts above

4. **Explore**: Navigate between admin and branch dashboards

## 📝 What Changed

### Removed

- ❌ All Supabase integration code
- ❌ Database connections
- ❌ Supabase authentication hooks
- ❌ API calls to Supabase

### Kept

- ✅ All UI components and design
- ✅ Authentication flow (using mock data)
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Role-based navigation
- ✅ All styling and layouts

## 💡 Implementation Details

**AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):

- Replaced Supabase auth with mock authentication
- Uses localStorage for session persistence
- Mock users defined in-code with predefined credentials

**Login Page** (`src/app/login/page.tsx`):

- Simple form that validates against mock users
- Shows demo credentials for easy access

**Data Storage**:

- Products and other data stored in component state (useProducts hook)
- No persistence beyond browser refresh (purely frontend demo)

## 🔄 To Re-enable Supabase (Future)

If you want to connect to a real database later:

1. Restore Supabase dependencies in `package.json`
2. Replace mock auth in `AuthContext.tsx` with Supabase auth
3. Follow instructions in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

## 📱 Current State

This is now a **fully functional UI prototype** that demonstrates:

- Modern dashboard design
- Authentication flow
- Role-based access control
- Responsive layouts
- Product management interface

Perfect for showcasing the design and user experience without backend complexity!
